# Walmart_Sales_Forecasting

Walmart, Inc. is part of the retail and wholesale business and is based in Bentonville, Arkansas. The President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director is C. Douglas McMillon. Walmart operates Walmart, Walmart Neighborhood Market, Wal-Mart, Walmart.com, and Samâ€™s Club. Retail companies commonly have issues with predicting sales accurately throughout the days, months, and years ahead. There are many varying factors that can cause issues with predicting sales such as holidays, economic factors, temperature, fuel prices, Consumer Price Index (CPI), and unemployment. Sales are the lifeblood of business. With an accurate sales forecast in hand, one can plan wisely. If the varying factors are not predicted correctly, then there could be staffing issues at stores, financial implications, and the business could become obsolete if customer satisfaction goes down.
